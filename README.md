##To run the ant task,need to rename the build-lessc.xml or build-rhino.xml to build.xml.
build-lessc.xml use the "lessc" command which has already installed in your computer from lesscss.org,I have used a shellscript file "less.sh" to invoke this command.
build-rhino.xml use the third party libs in the directory "libs".
